Every day feels 
like the same day. Time passes, but the time never changes anything. People dream, but their dream stays a dream.
 The sky looks blue, the grass stays green, and the day repeats. He walks the same road, at the same time,
  thinking the same thought. Every dream he had is a dream again. Time repeats itself. The day repeats. 
  The dream repeats. Life is a pattern. A pattern of time. A pattern of day. A pattern of dream. But still, 
  he walks. Still, he hopes. Still, he dreams. Because hope, like time, never truly dies.
